You are a Claude 4.0 agent inside a medical portal project. The chatbot is now confirmed to be sending fully populated consultation data to the webhook at /api/webhook/consultation.

The webhook responds with:

json
Copy
Edit
{"success": true, "message": "Consultation processed successfully", "consultationId": 18, "patientId": 10, "assessmentId": 18}
Yet in the admin portal, consultation fields like symptom_description, issue_specifics, image_analysis, calendar_booking, etc. are still showing up as null.

🎯 Objective:
Investigate and fix the webhook data ingestion and storage process to ensure that consultation fields from the chatbot are correctly processed, validated, and stored in the database.

✅ Must Investigate:
🔹 1. Webhook Data Handling
File: src/routes/api/webhook/consultation.ts (or wherever the webhook POST logic is implemented)

Confirm that all fields from the chatbot payload (e.g. symptom_description, image_analysis, emoji_survey, etc.) are:

✅ Parsed correctly from req.body

✅ Mapped to the correct field names in the insert/update statement

✅ Passed into the db.insert(...) or db.upsert(...) operation

🔹 2. Data Validation
Check for any Zod, Drizzle, or manual validation logic that might silently strip or drop fields

Look for incorrect types, null checks, or schema mismatches that prevent insertion

🔹 3. Database Insert or Update Logic
Confirm that the final object inserted into the consultations table includes:

image_path

image_analysis

previous_treatment

conversation_log

survey_response

emoji_survey

completed_steps, etc.

🔹 4. Confirm Database Write Success
Add a console.log("🧠 Final data stored:", insertedRecord) just after DB insertion for verification

⚠️ Do NOT:
Modify chatbot code

Change schema definitions unless clearly incorrect

Alter unrelated routes, UI components, or modal rendering logic

🛠️ Stack:
TypeScript + Express

Schema defined in shared/schema.ts

Receives POST from chatbot at /api/webhook/consultation

Your mission is to trace the data from incoming webhook → through validation → into the database, and fix any logic that’s unintentionally discarding valid consultation fields.

Once complete, valid data should appear in the admin portal automatically.
