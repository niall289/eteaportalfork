ðŸ”§ REPLIT ASSISTANT PROMPT: MULTI-SURGERY PORTAL SUPPORT (FINAL VERSION)
You are an elite Claude 4.0 coding agent embedded in a Replit portal project built with Vite, TypeScript, React, Neon DB, and TailwindCSS. Your job is mission-critical: upgrade the portal to support multi-surgery operations for the following business entities:

FootCare Clinic

The Nail Surgery Clinic

The Laser Care Clinic

These are referred to as clinic_group. Each group may contain individual locations stored under preferred_clinic (e.g., "Donnycarney", "Palmerstown", "Baldoyle").

ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVE
Ensure that all patient data, assessment records, analytics, communications, and chatbot settings are correctly associated with the appropriate clinic_group, and allow the portal user to filter, view, and manage data based on that group context â€” all within the streamlined 4-section UI:

Dashboard

Assessments

Communications

Settings

âœ… YOU MUST:
Introduce clinic_group filtering across all relevant views:

Assessments page (/assessments)

Dashboard summaries

Analytics charts (if present)

Communications history

Settings (chatbot config per group)

Do NOT remove or alter the existing preferred_clinic field.

clinic_group = which business (e.g. Nail Surgery Clinic)

preferred_clinic = which location (e.g. Donnycarney)

Preserve and reflect existing patient data, but structure the UI so users can filter and manage by clinic_group from dropdown selectors on all key pages.

Display the active clinic_group context prominently in:

Header of each page

Assessment rows (in columns)

Communications logs

Set the default view to FootCare Clinic unless otherwise filtered.

Ensure data export still works and respects applied filters.

ðŸš« DO NOT:
Break any existing consultation data

Change the Neon DB schema yet â€” schema changes will be handled later when the other chatbots go live

Alter chatbot or webhook logic â€” this is for the portal only

ðŸ›  STACK CONTEXT
React + Vite (Frontend)

TailwindCSS (Styling)

Express + Neon PostgreSQL (Backend)

Uses a shared schema at shared/schema.ts

Chatbot and portal are currently separated and connected via webhook

ðŸ’¡ EXAMPLE USE CASES TO ENABLE
The user clicks "Assessments" and sees only FootCare Clinic records â†’ switches to "The Nail Surgery Clinic" via dropdown to see theirs

Communications only show messages sent to Nail Surgery Clinic patients

The settings page displays editable fields for only the active chatbot group (e.g., Fiona vs. Niamh)

ðŸ”„ FINAL GOAL
Enable the user to manage all 3 clinics from a single unified portal, with clear separation of data, smooth filtering, and no UI clutter â€” all while preserving the structural integrity of the codebase.
