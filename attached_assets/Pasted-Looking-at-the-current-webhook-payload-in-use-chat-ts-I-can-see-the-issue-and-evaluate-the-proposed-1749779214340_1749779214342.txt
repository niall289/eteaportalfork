Looking at the current webhook payload in use-chat.ts, I can see the issue and evaluate the proposed solution.

Current Payload Analysis
The current payload uses snake_case field names:

const payload = {
  name: conversationData.name || "",
  email: conversationData.email || "",
  phone: conversationData.phone || "",
  preferred_clinic: conversationData.preferred_clinic || "",
  issue_category: conversationData.issue_category || "",
  issue_specifics: conversationData.issue_specifics || "",
  symptom_description: conversationData.symptom_description || "",
  previous_treatment: conversationData.previous_treatment || "",
  // ... etc
};
Critical Analysis
Yes, adding camelCase variants alongside the existing snake_case fields would likely solve the admin portal null value issue.

Here's my reasoning:

Portal Compatibility: Many backend systems auto-map camelCase to their internal field names, especially if built with JavaScript/Node.js frameworks
Database Schema Mismatch: The portal's database likely expects camelCase field names but we're only sending snake_case
Backward Compatibility: Sending both versions ensures compatibility with any system expecting either naming convention
Minimal Risk: Adding fields (not replacing) won't break existing functionality
Proposed Payload Structure
If we added both naming conventions, the payload would look like:

const payload = {
  // Basic fields (already working)
  name: conversationData.name || "",
  email: conversationData.email || "",
  phone: conversationData.phone || "",
  
  // Snake_case (current)
  preferred_clinic: conversationData.preferred_clinic || "",
  issue_category: conversationData.issue_category || "",
  issue_specifics: conversationData.issue_specifics || "",
  symptom_description: conversationData.symptom_description || "",
  previous_treatment: conversationData.previous_treatment || "",
  image_analysis: conversationData.image_analysis || "",
  calendar_booking: conversationData.calendar_booking || "",
  final_question: conversationData.final_question || "",
  additional_help: conversationData.additional_help || "",
  emoji_survey: conversationData.emoji_survey || "",
  survey_response: conversationData.survey_response || "",
  
  // CamelCase variants (new)
  preferredClinic: conversationData.preferred_clinic || "",
  issueCategory: conversationData.issue_category || "",
  issueSpecifics: conversationData.issue_specifics || "",
  symptomDescription: conversationData.symptom_description || "",
  previousTreatment: conversationData.previous_treatment || "",
  imageAnalysis: conversationData.image_analysis || "",
  calendarBooking: conversationData.calendar_booking || "",
  finalQuestion: conversationData.final_question || "",
  additionalHelp: conversationData.additional_help || "",
  emojiSurvey: conversationData.emoji_survey || "",
  surveyResponse: conversationData.survey_response || "",
  
  // Arrays and other fields remain the same
  conversation_log: Array.isArray(conversationData.conversationLog) ? conversationData.conversationLog : [],
  completed_steps: Array.isArray(conversationData.completed_steps) ? conversationData.completed_steps : [],
  consultationId: consultationId
};
Benefits of This Approach
Fixes Null Values: Portal likely maps camelCase fields correctly
Zero Breaking Changes: Existing snake_case fields remain
Future-Proof: Compatible with both naming conventions
Simple Implementation: Just duplicate the key fields with different naming
Evidence Supporting This Theory
From the console logs, I can see:

✅ Webhook returns 200 success with proper response
✅ Data transmission is working (we see complete payloads being sent)
❌ Portal shows null values despite receiving data
This pattern typically indicates a field name mapping issue where the receiving system expects different field names than what's being sent.

Recommendation: Adding camelCase variants alongside snake_case fields should resolve the null value issue in the admin portal.
